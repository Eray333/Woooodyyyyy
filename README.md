# Woooody

## Theme
**Woooody** is a forest / woodland themed exploration experience focused on environmental audio immersion and spatial sound design.

## Game Mechanics
- FPS character controller (WASD movement, mouse look)
- Environmental interaction through proximity-based sound zones
- Main Menu with Play / Exit UI

## Game Feel (Juiciness)
- Footstep sounds vary based on surface (grass, wood)
- Pitch randomization is used to avoid repetitive audio feedback
- Smooth fade-in / fade-out ambience when entering forest areas

## Audio System
Audio is organized using Unity’s Audio System:
- UI Sounds (menu hover & click)
- Ambience (forest wind, birds)
- SFX (footsteps)

3D spatial audio is used for world sounds with proper min/max distance settings and volume falloff.

## Sound Production & Sources

### Custom / Edited by Me
- **All footstep sounds** (grass & wood surfaces)
- **All UI sounds** (menu hover & button click)
- Pitch randomization and volume balancing were applied manually

### External Sources (Edited & Integrated)
- Forest wind & leaves ambience
- Dog sound
- Bird sounds
